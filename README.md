*DESCRIPTION*: This Java program implements a multithreaded client–server chat application using core Java networking tools such as Socket, ServerSocket, ObjectInputStream, and ObjectOutputStream. The system consists of three main components: the ChatMessage class for defining message types, the Client program that connects users to the server and sends/receives messages, and the Server program that manages multiple clients simultaneously through separate threads. It runs on any Java-supported platform such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, or the command-line JDK. The application uses multithreading to handle parallel clients and supports features like broadcasting messages, private messaging using @username, listing active users, and logging out. This type of task is commonly used in real-world applications such as chat rooms, customer support systems, collaborative tools, messaging platforms, and any system requiring concurrent real-time communication between multiple users.
